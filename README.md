The access control wrapper is designed with the aim of preventing third-party non-CPU master modules from violating System-on-Chip security. It includes the RISC-V Physical Memory Protection (PMP), Control Status Registers (CSR), a TileLink Uncached Lightweight (TL-UL) 
CPU interface and an access control logic in the form of a finite state machine with two states: IDLE and BLOCK. The PMP configuration can only be written through the CPU interface and is independent of the state of the wrapper. Incoming messages from the master are 
checked by the PMP during the IDLE state and only pass to the crossbar if they are allowed. Every illegal message gets blocked and the wrapper changes to the BLOCK state, where every message from the master is blocked, until the CPU requests a return to IDLE.
